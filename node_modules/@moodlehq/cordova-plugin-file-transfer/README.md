# cordova-plugin-file-transfer (fork)

This is a fork of `cordova-plugin-file-transfer` by [Moodle HQ](https://moodle.com/). If you are looking for the documentation, you can read the original at [apache/cordova-plugin-file-transfer](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file-transfer).

## Modifications from the original

We created this fork for [our mobile application](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodleapp) because there are some commits in the development branch that haven't been released. So this package doesn't have any extra modifications (other than name and version).

You can see all the changes here: [1.7.1...moodlemobile:v1.7.1-moodle.5](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file-transfer/compare/1.7.1...moodlemobile:v1.7.1-moodle.5)

## Installation

You can install this package using the [original installation instructions](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file-transfer#installation), but installing this package instead:

```sh
cordova plugin add @moodlehq/cordova-plugin-file-transfer@1.7.1-moodle.5
```
